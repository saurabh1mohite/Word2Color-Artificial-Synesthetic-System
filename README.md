# Artificial-Synesthetic-System
It is an attempt to simulate the learning process of word-color synesthesia. Word-color synesthesia is a neurological condition in which the person affected sees colors in words, it is very uncommon and found less. The most common form of synesthesia is the grapheme-color synesthesia where the person affected sees colors in the smallest unit of word, i.e. alphabets and numbers. These experiences are believed to be the result of childhood exposure to language, so we have done the same here, and exosed our system to lots of words in their respective contexts and tried predicting the colors in an unsupervised manner.
